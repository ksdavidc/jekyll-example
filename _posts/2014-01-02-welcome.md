Hi there! You're looking at an example Jekyll project built by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). It's a simple site built to show folks how to use Sass with Jekyll. It's open sourced under the MIT license and can be download from [the GitHub project](2014/09/25/sass-and-jekyll/://github.com/mdo/jekyll-example).

here is a  [link](https://ksdavidc.github.io/jekyll-example/_posts/2014-01-02-welcome.md)
